# Smart NINT: Machine Learning Emulation of Interactive Atmospheric Composition

This repository presents **Smart NINT**, a novel machine learning (ML) framework designed to emulate the computationally expensive process of **interactive atmospheric composition** transport within Earth System Models (ESMs), specifically tested using the NASA GISS-ModelE3 (ModelE).

***

## Overview

Traditional ESMs often rely on pre-computed, static tracer concentrations (**Non-Interactive Tracers, NINT**) to save computational resources, which sacrifices the ability to capture real-time aerosol-climate feedbacks. Smart NINT addresses this limitation by using a **spatiotemporal deep learning architecture** to interactively calculate tracer concentrations, such as **Black Carbon from Biomass Burning (BCB)**, based on real-time surface emissions and meteorological data.

This approach effectively shifts the modeling paradigm from simple numerical solver mimicry to advanced spatio-temporal forecasting, offering a viable path for higher-resolution, reliable long-term climate projections without the prohibitive cost of full physics parameterizations.

## Key Features

* **Computational Efficiency:** Significantly reduces the cost of simulating composition transport, enabling higher-resolution and longer transient climate simulations.
* **Interactive Feedback:** Emulates interactive emissions, allowing the climate model to capture real-time feedback between aerosols and other climate processes.
* **Spatiotemporal Architecture:** Utilizes a **ConvLSTM**-based architecture with an inductive bias specifically designed to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependencies in tracer evolution.
* **High Performance:** Achieves excellent performance for BCB concentrations, with **RÂ² values of 0.92** and **Pearson $r$ of 0.96** at the surface level, maintaining acceptable performance even outside the training domain.
* **Focus on Vertical Dynamics:** Incorporates a preprocessing module to effectively fuse 2D emission data with 3D meteorological forcings across the first 20 vertical levels (up to 656 hPa), where most short-term BCB variation occurs.

## Model Setup (Conceptual)

The model replaces the full physics solver for tracer transport with an ML component:

$$\text{Concentration}(t) = \text{Smart NINT} \left( \text{Emissions}(t), \text{Meteorology}(t), \text{Previous State} \right)$$

### Inputs

* **2D Surface Emissions:** Black Carbon from Biomass Burning (BCB).
* **3D Meteorological Data:** Forcings from ModelE (e.g., pressure, wind, temperature).

### Architecture Highlights

1.  **Preprocessing Module:** Fuses 2D emission data and 3D forcings into a unified spatiotemporal representation.
2.  **Core Model:** A spatiotemporal deep learning model (e.g., ConvLSTM) that learns the complex transport and mixing processes.

## Future Work

We aim to extend this methodology to other aerosol and gaseous tracers and integrate the Smart NINT framework into the operational ModelE for comprehensive long-term climate projections.
